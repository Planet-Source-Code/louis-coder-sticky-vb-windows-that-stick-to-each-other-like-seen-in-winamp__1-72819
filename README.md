## sticky VB windows that stick to each other \(like seen in Winamp\)


</div>

### Description

this project contains VB forms and modules you just add to your application. The code makes your application's windows become sticky, that means they stick to each other and to the screen edges. You can restore the old stick configuration after program restart with one function call (uses Registry)! Easy to use!
 
### More Info
 
If you use VB5, open 'GFWindowStick.vbp' and remove the 'Retained=0' line to be able to open the project! On March 6th 2010 I fixed the error that files were missing to run the code. Now it should work!
